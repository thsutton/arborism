The decomposition strategy used in a dynamic programming algorithm
determines how a particular problem instance will be broken up into
sub-problems. Some dynamic programming problems only admit a single
(up to symmetry) decomposition strategy (string edit distance,
matrix-chain multiplication, etc.) but others may have more
interesting structure. In the tree edit difference problem different
decomposition strategies can result in quite different tableaux
structures and, hence, asymptotic behaviour.
